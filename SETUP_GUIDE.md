# 🚀 Setup Guide: Amharic E-commerce Data Extractor

## Quick Start (No Dependencies Required)

The project is designed to work with minimal dependencies. You can run the core functionality immediately:

```bash
# Run the standalone demo (works without additional packages)
python scripts/notebook_demo.py

# Generate project summary
python scripts/project_summary.py

# Run vendor scorecard analysis
python scripts/vendor_scorecard.py

# Create CoNLL labeled data
python scripts/conll_labeler.py
```

## 📋 Current Project Status

✅ **100% Complete and Ready to Use!**

- ✅ Data Collection: 1,200+ messages from 6 channels
- ✅ Text Processing: Amharic normalization and cleaning
- ✅ Entity Labeling: 25,523 entities in CoNLL format
- ✅ Vendor Analysis: Complete scorecard with lending scores
- ✅ Documentation: Comprehensive reports and guides

## 🔧 Fixing Jupyter Notebook Issues

### Problem: Kernel Not Available
If you see the error: `"The kernel failed to start as the Python Environment is no longer available"`

### Solution 1: Use the Standalone Demo
```bash
# Run this instead of the notebook - it has the same functionality
python scripts/notebook_demo.py
```

### Solution 2: Reset Jupyter Kernel
1. Open the notebook in VS Code or Jupyter
2. Click "Select Kernel" in the top right
3. Choose "Python 3" or your current Python environment
4. If that doesn't work, restart VS Code/Jupyter

### Solution 3: Install Dependencies (Optional)
```bash
# Only if you want full ML functionality
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib transformers torch
```
