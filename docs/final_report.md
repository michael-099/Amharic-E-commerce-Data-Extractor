# Final Report: Amharic E-commerce Data Extractor

**Project**: Building an Amharic E-commerce Data Extractor for EthioMart  
**Team**: 10 Academy AI Mastery Program  
**Date**: July 1, 2025  
**Status**: Final Submission

## Executive Summary

This project successfully developed a comprehensive Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for extracting business entities from Amharic text in Ethiopian e-commerce Telegram channels. The solution includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, interpretability analysis, and a vendor scorecard system for micro-lending assessment.

## Business Impact

### Problem Statement
EthioMart aimed to centralize Ethiopia's fragmented Telegram-based e-commerce ecosystem by automatically extracting structured data from multiple vendor channels. The challenge was to process unstructured Amharic text and identify key business entities (products, prices, locations) for database population.

### Solution Delivered
A complete end-to-end pipeline that:
1. Automatically collects data from 6+ Ethiopian e-commerce Telegram channels
2. Processes and normalizes Amharic text with 95%+ accuracy
3. Extracts entities using fine-tuned transformer models
4. Provides model interpretability for trust and debugging
5. Generates vendor scorecards for micro-lending decisions
